# Claude Pwn Assistant

Instructions for Claude to act as a CTF pwn teammate.

## Files

**CLAUDE.md**
- Instructions for the AI agent
- Defines how it should help you
- Makes it a strict coach, not an answer machine

**note.md**
- YOUR workspace - AI never edits this
- Write your discoveries, attempts, and thoughts here
- Plain text, no fancy formatting needed
- AI reads this to understand what you've tried

## How to Use

1. Put `CLAUDE.md` in your workspace
2. Create `note.md` for each challenge
3. Document what you discover in `note.md`
4. Ask Claude for help - it will read your notes first
5. If you haven't tried anything, Claude will push back

The agent won't give you answers. It will guide you, explain concepts, and help you think through problems.
